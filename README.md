# PiCamera-GUI
A mininalistic picamera GUI to take pictures ~~or videos~~ with Raspberry-Pi.

An effort to make an simple picamera application to take pictures and videos with picamera module in python. Initially it is a script to take only pictures but hopefully I will get time to extend it to take videos and set the different camera parameters.
